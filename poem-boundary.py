# This is a program to download specific pages from digitized poem collections
# based on given poem boundary annotation files
# in an HTRC data capsule (https://analytics.hathitrust.org/staticcapsules).

# The dataset contains five folders that include poem files.
# The folder names are: aa_poets, apa-aa_poets, apa-pa_poets, lxa_poets, na_poets
# The poem boundary annotation files are in CSV format.
# The poem pages are in TXT format.
